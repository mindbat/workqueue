# workqueue

A GTD approach to project management.

## Objective

To be a pure workflow tool.

Most developers hate complicated task-tracking tools.

PMs hate the simple ones because they can't get any data out of it.

We'll keep things as bare bones as possible for devs, and offer rich analytical tools for project managers.
